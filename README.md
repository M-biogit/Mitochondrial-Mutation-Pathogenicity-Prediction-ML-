# Mitochondrial-Mutation-Pathogenicity-Prediction (ML)
Predicting pathological status of mitochondrial genome mutations using Machine Learning.

Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a specific mutation in the Mitochondrial Genome is "Pathogenic" (disease-causing) or "Benign" (harmless) using Machine Learning classifiers.

Dataset
The dataset includes mtDNA mutation records with binary classification labels.
